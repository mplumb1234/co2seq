# Questions About The Project
1. What key features should be included on the map? So far we've come up with these for carbon sources:
   - Pipelines (transportation)
   - Powerplants
   

    And these for carbon storage:
    - Sands/plays/fields (what are the differences between these, should all be included?)
    - Reservoirs
    - Unmineable coal
    - Saline formations
    - Basalt formations
    - Shale basins
    - Offshore storage (Is there a better/more specific term for this?)
    - Wells
    - Platforms

Are we missing anything? Should some of these not be included?

2. What are some key attributes that should be displayed when inspecting the respective features? We've found a lot of attributes but aren't sure which are important and which aren't. 
Examples:
    - Distance between carbon sources and carbon storage
    - Name of feature (are IDs important?)
    - Owning company (powerplants, platforms)
    - Chronozone (sands/plays/fields)
    - Depth (wells, offshore storage)

3. Does the type of feature matter? Should some types be left out or left in but specified?
    - Ethanol vs biodiesel vs natural gas plants
    - Coal vs oil fields
    - Oil vs natural gas vs petroleum vs HGL pipelines
    - Oil vs gas sands/plays/fields

4. Specifically for the Gulf of Mexico, what carbon storage sites are relevant? We had trouble finding accessible data for offshore storage, but onshore storage data is plentiful. 
Are onshore coastal formations and facilities used for CCS in the Gulf?

5. Some of the resources you shared with us contain data on GHG emissions, mostly by country. Although these are obviously relevant to the CCS process, is this data pertinent 
for the interactive map we are making?
